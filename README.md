# Netflix-Show-Exploratory-Analysis

## About the project
The goal of this project is to practice my Python analysis skills and to explore and analyze the dataset. Netflix is one of the largest streaming platforms with hundreds of TV shows and movies. Through this project, we hope to understand the types of shows and movies that are added to Netflix, which categories/genres are the most and least popular, and how Netflix can use this analysis to simply see overall what content they have.
### About the dataset
The file was retrieved on Kaggle. com. Unfortunely, the dataset does not have information on the watch-times or click rates per show and movie; it is mainly used for exploratory analysis.
